Home automation proof of concept using RaspbrryPi and Telegram bot. Here I show how to control GPIO pins using a telegram bot running on your RaspberryPi

You will need to install python library for telegram bot, the details can be found here:
https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/

For simplicity type the following on the terminal of your RaspberryPi:


pip3 install python-telegram-bot --upgrade

I am saying pip3 because i want this installed for python3 and not python2, by default both versions of python are autoinstalled on Raspbian OS.
